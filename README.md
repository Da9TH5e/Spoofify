## ðŸš€ Getting Started

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

# or
npm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result. The app will automatically reload if you make any edits.

### Bypassing Payment Gateway
* To simulate a subscription upon user registration using Google login:

* When users first log in with their Google account, they will be prompted to subscribe to listen to songs.

* Use the following test credit card details to bypass the payment gateway:

**Card Number**: 4242 4242 4242 4242  
**Expiration Date**: 05/55  
**CVV**: 555  
**Name**: 1  
**City**: 1  
**Address**: 1  
**Region**: Croatia  

Hit the Subscribe button to complete the process.
